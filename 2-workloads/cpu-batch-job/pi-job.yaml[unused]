# Workload 2: CPU-Intensive Batch Job
#
# Type: Job
# Goal: To observe how VPA recommends resources for short-lived,
#       CPU-bound tasks.
# This job calculates Pi to 2000 places using Perl. It will consume a
# burst of CPU and then terminate.

        # during the calculation and recommend a more appropriate value.

  # Note: To test VPA recommendations for this job, you may need to
  # run it multiple times to generate history. A CronJob is a more
